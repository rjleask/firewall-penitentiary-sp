Working title: Firewall Penitentiary
# firewall-penitentiary: A game by Daniel Day, Jamie Leask, Thomas Murphy and Matthew Sullivan
It is the year 2103CE and the planet now stands on the brink of overpopulation.  
To save on space and reduce overhead, convicted criminals are now hard wired into 'on-line virtual prisons,' 
computer simulations in which their brains interface directly with server while their bodies are kept
healthy but paralyzed until they have served out their sentence.  In some cases, especially where
criminals with a more violent history are concerned, their antics are broadcast on the media bands as a 
form of entertainment.  A modern cybersport, if you will.  A fraction of the proceeds help fund the 
ailing justice system but the majority serve to line the pockets of investors and CEOs.

A game written in JavaScript and uses Phaser library.
